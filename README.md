# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the School District Analysis
The purpose of this school district analysis is to analyze each school, regarding to their sizes, budgets, school reading scores, math scores, overall scores, through manipulating data, replacing data and finding data that we seeks, to see the results and compare and contrast the results from different schools, or within the same school, we can see their reading and math scores, that way we can evalutate their performance. Also, through budgets, sizes, student numbers and etc, we can control budgets, and decide whether to increase or decrease budgets, we can do anything we want by looking at the analysis result. 

## Results
- From the results of the deliverable 2: I've discovered that overall performance of the schools is so diverse, the best 5 perform schools are charter schools, meanwhile the bottom 5 performance schools are all district schools, by overall performance, I mean the overall passing percentage of the students. 
- While the overall performance of the charter schools is better than district schools, I've found out that their spending is generally less than district schools, which I find interesting, because the resources (Per Student Budget) that they spend on each student is higher than those students in charter schools, their performance is lower. 
- For the Spending Ranges, I've found out that less money they spend on each student their overall passing percentage is higher, like '<$584' category their '% Overall Passing' is the highest, which is 90.37% (Shocking). 
- Last, after comparing charter and district schools, I found out that charter schools are beating district schools on each category (passing percentage). 

## Summary
To summarize this analysis challenge, I think that after seeing the scores, and spendings summaries, I can conclude that charter schools are performing in a much better level than the district schools. This could be very valuable to the future analysis on how to allocate budgets to different schools.
